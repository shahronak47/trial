Problem #3 : It seems to be a optimizer behavior to plan excessive right outside frozen horizon. Would further investigate this as a separate dedicated ticket for this

INC1186317,"Hi Lynn.

We have an open incident with master data taem for this issue - INC1183358

Thus we would mark this ticket as duplicate and cancel. I will keep you posted on the progress of that ticket over email"
INC1186204,"Hi Carol,

Following are some of the reasons which may cause a seemingly high deployment recommendation

1. Inventory target at the RDCs - IBP optimizer would try to meet inventory target at the RDCs across 800 day horizon (more than next 2 years). It would try to ensure that RDC never in next 2 years dips below inventory target. This may cause a seemingly high deployment recommendation in the short term, but it might be required for long term
2. Open STOs in S4 - Optimizer considers any open STO in S4 as the ""Minimum quantity "" to be sent to the RtsDC
3. Independent demand changes
4. Minimum lot size quantities - Optimizer would anything in lot sizes even tough the requirement is low, it would send in lot size quantities.

For now I would close this incident as issue is not reproducible in the mentioned SKU. Please review above reasons, if you still find any anomalies, please create a new incident for the same/email with the example

Thanks
Vijay"

Hi Daniel, As I mentioned in another ticket â€“ there is no change history enabled for the override to check if the jobs or any manual input at the location level (though the planners provide in country level only) has caused the override to sit on one location and not on another. Please reenter the override for now and if you happen to get similar issues â€“ I can check with Derek if we can enable the change history for this KF as well.
